## üß† 1. Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs)  
LLMs are reshaping how we think about AI, communication, and problem-solving. In 2025, I want to:  
- Learn the fundamentals of how LLMs like GPT work under the hood.  
- Explore practical applications of LLMs in coding, content creation, and decision-making.  
- Dive into fine-tuning and prompt engineering to get the most out of these powerful tools.  

### Resources I'll Explore:  
- something along like this - https://n8n.io/   
- Courses on Hugging Face and OpenAI  
- Practical projects using Python and TensorFlow/PyTorch

## üõ†Ô∏è 2. Mastering DevOps in Depth  
DevOps isn‚Äôt just about tools; it‚Äôs about culture and processes. In 2025, I aim to:  
- Gain a deeper understanding of CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure as code.  
- Work with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and Jenkins.  
- Focus on scalability, monitoring, and observability for production environments.  
- Understand cloud-native DevOps with AWS, Azure, or GCP.  

### Resources I'll Explore:  
- Hands-on labs and projects
